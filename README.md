# QA Onboarding Checklist 🚀

Being the **only QA on a project** can be overwhelming.  
No clear processes, no documentation, and no one to explain what should be done.  
That’s why I created this **QA Must-Haves Checklist** — a structured onboarding guide for QAs starting new projects.

---

## 🌟 Why this checklist?
When onboarding as a QA, I repeatedly faced the same issues:
- Too much time wasted chasing access, credentials, or the right people.
- Unclear responsibilities leading to conflicts with the team.
- Critical details (like Jira workflow or bug reporting rules) discovered too late.
- PMs being unhappy because QA work looked inefficient and the project slowed down.

✅ This checklist fixes that by giving both **QAs and PMs** a structured list of questions and checkpoints to cover from day one.

## 📂 What’s inside?

The checklist is organized into sections:

- **General** – methodology, QA metrics, credentials  
- **Jira** – workflows, ticket handling, backlog management  
- **Defect management** – bug reporting, prioritization, handling old bugs  
- **Releases** – release flow, blockers, regression, production testing  
- **Environments** – staging vs production, test data, restrictions  
- **Testing process** – strategies, edge cases, plugins, coverage  
- **Test documentation** – existing docs, regression checklists, workflows for TCs  
- **Other** – bug analysis and root causes  

Total: **36 questions** to guide your onboarding.
